# Algorithmic trading with Keras (using LSTM)


Traditional approaches to stock market analysis and stock price prediction include fundamental analysis, which looks at a stock's past performance and the general credibility of the company itself, and statistical analysis, which is solely concerned with number crunching and identifying patterns in stock price variation. The latter is commonly achieved with the help of Genetic Algorithms (GA) or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's), but these fail to capture correlation between stock prices in the form of long-term temporal dependencies. Another major issue with using simple ANNs for stock predictions the phenomenon of exploding / vanishing gradient, where the weights of a large network either become too large or too small (respectively), drastically slowing their convergence to the optimal value.

We compute the gross and net yield (as it is by the Italian law: 26% tax on capital gain and 0.10% fee to the broker at each transaction): our model performed roughly a 10% net annual yield (which is not bad, considering the 2008 crisis)
